			<li><span style="font-weight: 900">Swiss People's Party</span> (SVP/UDC):	Most of the Swiss-German cantons are already favoring the SVP/UDC in their current configuration. One notable change is the fact that the Bern canton has been boosted in order to absorb left-wing municipalities that will be compensated by Bern’s conservative countryside. Furthermore, the cantons of Central Switzerland have been recombined in order to undermine the influence of the Christian-Democrats.</li>
			<li><span style="font-weight: 900">Social Democratic Party of Switzerland</span> (SP/PS): In Northern Switzerland many of the urban areas such as Zürich, Winterthur and St-Gallen have been separated from the countryside in order to avoid getting balanced out. In Western Switzerland, the most notable change is that Wallis has been split in half.</li>
			<li><span style="font-weight: 900">The Liberals</span> (FDP/PLR/PRD): The FDP/PLR also already benefits from the current configuration of Northern Switzerland. Most notably, Fribourg, Neuchâtel and Jura, cantons where the party is unpopular, are partially integrated into cantons that are more favorable, such as Vaud and Bern. As for Central Switzerland, many of the cantons are bundled into a single “Super Schwyz” in order to separate the unfavorable from the favorable electorates.</li>
			<li><span style="font-weight: 900">Christian Democratic People's Party of Switzerland</span> (CVP/PDC): Since its optimal canton distribution is close to the current one, the CVP/PDC seems to already benefit from the current configuration of cantons. However one notable change is the fact that Zürich has been switched from Zürich Canton to Aargau.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>The main trend in all these results seems to be that each party would seek to absorb small towns to cantons in which it is already sure to get a good score in order to mitigate losses in cantons in which they are unpopular. Since there are less seats on the Council of States than the National Council, it is thus the most susceptible to be swayed using gerrymandering tactics.</p>
